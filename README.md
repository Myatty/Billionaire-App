# Nga Tat Pyar

Nga Tat Pyar is a cross-platform mobile app developed using flutter as part of learning process. This app serves only one purpose (u can guess it by the name),  which is giving u a mere amount of money everytime u click a button. Legend says the real operator of this app (the legendary NgaTatPyar) steals the money from the rich and gives u(the poor xD). So in memory of this legend, I had to decide his name should be inscribed in the app honoring his legacy of redistribution of weath.
